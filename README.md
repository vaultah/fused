Lightweight ORM-ish convenience wrapper around redis-py.

Still pretty raw.


----------


There're 2 main types of fields: *embedded* and *standalone*.

***Embedded*** fields are stored in a Redis hash linked to the primary key. Fused converts the value of an embedded field to string, due to limitations of Redis hashes. Values of missing embedded fields are `None`.

Each ***standalone*** field occupies a separate key. A standalone field can either be a proxy or an "auto" field. Values of missing proxy fields are proxy objects. Values of missing auto fields are empty objects of corresponding Python types (i.e. `''` for `String`s and `[]` for `List`s.

Fused decodes all strings coming from Redis (including individual elements/values/keys of auto fields) except for

 - values of `Bytes` fields, because that would defeat the purpose of `Bytes` fields
 - strings returned by methods of proxy objects, because it would be hard, and because proxy fields simply return what redis-py returns
