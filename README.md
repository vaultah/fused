Still pretty raw.


----------

There're 2 main types of fields: embedded and standalone.

Embedded fields are stored in a Redis hash linked to the primary key. Fused converts the value of an embedded field to string, due to limitations of Redis hashes.

Standalone fields are stored as a separate key. A standalone field can either be a proxy or an "auto" field.
